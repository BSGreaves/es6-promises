## ES6 & Promises: Matching Up Humans to Desired Pets

#### Instructions
1. Use AJAX to pull information on humans and animals from local JSON files.
1. For each human, match them to the appropriate animals for them, based on their preference and kid-friendly needs.
1. ES6-ify it with let, const, fat arrow functions and "use strict";


#### To Run Project [Node Must Be Installed]:
